# EsfUsd: Execution Scene Foundation for Usd

> [!note]
> This library is not meant for public use.

The esfUsd library is built on top of [esf](../esf/README.md).

The esfUsd library provides interfaces that allow the execution system to access
scene objects defined on a UsdStage in order to build and evaluate execution
networks.
