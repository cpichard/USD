# Ef: Execution Foundation

The ef library is built on top of [vdf](../vdf/README.md).

The ef library extends functionality provided by [vdf](../vdf/README.md),
providing VdfNode types, types that implement VdfExecutorInterface, structures
for caching values and network traversals, and various utility functions.
