# Tutorial 1: Computing values in OpenExec

## Overview

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to use OpenExec APIs to
request values to be computed.

One thing to note is that the API that is presented here is the lowest-level
API, designed for performance-intensive clients, such as an imaging
system. OpenExec will eventually include convenience API, layered on top of the
API shown here, for use cases that don't require maximum performance and for use
cases that adhere to certain patterns that allow for more convenient API while
still maintaining maxiumum performance.

For this tutorial, we will make use of the `computeLocalToWorldTransform`
computations provided by UsdGeomXformable prims. The result of this computation
on a given Xform is a 4x4 matrix that transforms points local to that Xform into
points in world-space. The result of this computation depends on two values:
  1. The authored value of the `transform` attribute on the given Xform.
  2. The computed result of `computeLocalToWorldTransform` recursively invoked
     on the Xform's parent Xform.

## Create a UsdStage

The first step is to create a UsdStage from a scene that contains
UsdGeomXformable prims, such as the scene described by this usda file:

```
    #usda 1.0

    def Xform "Root" (
        kind = "component"
    )
    {
        uniform token[] xformOpOrder = [ "xformOp:transform" ]
        matrix4d xformOps:transform = (
            (1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0, 1) )

        def Xform "A1"
        {
            uniform token[] xformOpOrder = [ "xformOp:transform" ]
            matrix4d xformOps:transform = (
                (1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1, 0), (0, 2, 0, 1) )
        }

        def Xform "A2"
        {
            uniform token[] xformOpOrder = [ "xformOp:transform" ]
            matrix4d xformOps:transform = (
                (1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 3, 1) )
        }
    }
```

Assuming this layer is in a file named "xformPrims.usda" we can open the layer
on a UsdStage as follows:

```cpp
    UsdStageRefPtr stage = UsdStage::Open("xformPrims.usda");
```

## Create an ExecUsdSystem

In order to compute values from a UsdStage, we first need to create an
ExecUsdSystem object from the stage:

```cpp
    ExecUsdSystem execSystem(stage);
```

The system maintains the internal state needed to compute values that is common
across different requests for values from a given UsdStage. In particular, it
holds onto the compiled data flow **network** that is used for evaluation.

## Build an ExecUsdRequest

A set of values to be computed is specified by building an ExecUsdRequest. Each
requested value is identified by an ExecUsdValueKey, which contains a
**provider**--a UsdObject that provides a computation--and a TfToken that gives
the name of the requested computation.

To build a request containing a collection of value keys, we call
ExecUsdSystem::BuildRequest:

```cpp
    std::vector<ExecUsdValueKey> valueKeys {
        {stage->GetPrimAtPath(SdfPath("/Root/A1")),
         ExecGeomXformableTokens->computeLocalToWorldTransform},
        {stage->GetPrimAtPath(SdfPath("/Root/A2")),
         ExecGeomXformableTokens->computeLocalToWorldTransform},
    };

    const ExecUsdRequest request = execSystem.BuildRequest(std::move(valueKeys));
```

A request maintains state that is required to effiently compute the particular
set of requested values that it represents. In particular, it holds onto a
**schedule** that is used to accelerate evaluation, by amortizing across
multiple rounds of computation for a given request.

## Prepare the request

Preparing the request, by calling ExecUsdSystem::PrepareRequest, does two
things:
1. It ensures that the network held by the system is compiled for the
   request. I.e., it makes sure that all data flow nodes and connections that
   are required to compute the requested values are in present the network and
   that their structure is up-to-date with respect to the current authored state
   of the UsdStage.
2. It ensures that the request's schedule is up-to-date, and will re-schedule
   (including scheduling for the first time) if necessary.

```cpp
    execSystem.PrepareRequest(request);
```

Note that explicitly preparing the request is optional; if we call `Compute`
without first calling `PrepareRequest`, the call to `Compute` will prepare the
request before computing. However, it is often desirable for client code to
have explicit control over when the request is prepared, because of the cost of
doing so. I.e., compiling and scheduling tend to be more expensive than
computing, so it often makes sense to ensure these happen first, before multiple
rounds of computation.

## Compute values

To compute the set of requested values, we simply call ExecUsdSystem::Compute:

```cpp
    ExecUsdCacheView cache = execSystem.Compute(request);
```

The computed results are now ready, and can be acessed via the returned
ExecUsdCacheView object.

## Extract computed values

To access the computed values, we call ExecUsdCacheView::Get to extract them,
using indices that correspond to order of value keys in the vector used to build
the request:

```cpp
    VtValue value = cache.Get(0);
    const GfMatrix4d a1LocalToWorld = value.Get<GfMatrix4d>();
    value = cache.Get(1);
    const GfMatrix4d a2LocalToWorld = value.Get<GfMatrix4d>();
```

## Putting it all together

Bringing this all together into a single block of example code:

```cpp
    #include "pxr/base/gf/matrix4d.h"
    #include "pxr/base/vt/value.h"
    #include "pxr/exec/execGeom/tokens.h"
    #include "pxr/exec/execUsd/request.h"
    #include "pxr/exec/execUsd/system.h"
    #include "pxr/exec/execUsd/valueKey.h"
    #include "pxr/usd/sdf/path.h"
    #include "pxr/usd/usd/stage.h"

    #include <utility>
    #include <vector>

    void Example()
    {
        // Open the layer that contains our scene on a UsdStage.
        const UsdStageRefPtr stage = UsdStage::Open("xformPrims.usda");

        // Create an ExecUsdSystem, which we will use to evaluate computations
        // on the stage.
        ExecUsdSystem execSystem(stage);

        // Create a vector of value keys that indicate which computed values we
        // are requesting for evaluation.
        std::vector<ExecUsdValueKey> valueKeys {
            {stage->GetPrimAtPath(SdfPath("/Root/A1")),
             ExecGeomXformableTokens->computeLocalToWorldTransform},
            {stage->GetPrimAtPath(SdfPath("/Root/A2")),
             ExecGeomXformableTokens->computeLocalToWorldTransform},
        };

        // Build the request.
        const ExecUsdRequest request =
            execSystem.BuildRequest(std::move(valueKeys));

        // Prepare the request, ensuring the data flow graph is compiled and the
        // schedule is created.
        execSystem.PrepareRequest(request);

        // Evaluate the data flow graph according to the schedule, to yield the
        // requested computed values.
        ExecUsdCacheView cache = execSystem.Compute(request);

        // Extract the values.
        VtValue value = cache.Get(0);
        const GfMatrix4d a1LocalToWorld = value.Get<GfMatrix4d>();
        value = cache.Get(1);
        const GfMatrix4d a2LocalToWorld = value.Get<GfMatrix4d>();

        // The resulting matrices are the concatenation of the transforms
        // authored on A1 and Root and A2 and Root, respectively. Here, we
        // extract the translations from the resulting matrices, demonstrating
        // that we end up with the expected net translations necessary to
        // translate points in each local space into world space.
        TF_AXIOM(GfIsClose(
            a1LocalToWorld.ExtractTranslation(), GfVec3d(1, 2, 0), 1e-6));
        TF_AXIOM(GfIsClose(
            a2LocalToWorld.ExtractTranslation(), GfVec3d(1, 0, 3), 1e-6));
    }
```
