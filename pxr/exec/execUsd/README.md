# ExecUsd: Execution system for Usd

The execUsd library is built on top of [exec](../exec/README.md) and
[esfUsd](../esfUsd/README.md).

The execUsd library is the primary entry point for OpenExec. This library
provides facilities for compiling and evaluating data flow networks built from
UsdStage%s.
