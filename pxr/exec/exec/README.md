# Exec: Execution sytem core

The exec library is built on top of [vdf](../vdf/README.md),
[ef](../ef/README.md), and [esf](../esf/README.md).

The exec library provides facilities for defining computations that are provided
by objects in a scene, ingesting scenes and compiling data flow networks, and
evaluating data flow networks.
