# Vdf: Vectorized Data Flow

The vdf library provides the foundation for building and evaluating vectorized
dataflow netorks.

# Key Concepts

VdfNetwork embodies a dataflow network consisting of nodes (VdfNode) that
perform computation with data flowing from node outputs to node inputs
(see VdfConnection).
