    This museum test exercises a combination of ancestral references
    and payloads with sub-root specializes.

    /Overalls/Looks/Cloth_C_Weave_09_Satin has two specializes arcs
    from across the ancestral reference and payload on /Overalls
    that yield the same implied specializes arc at the root layer
    stack at /Overalls/Looks/Cloth_C_Weave_09. This is expected to
    be stronger than the propagated specializes arc from the ancestral
    reference at /Overalls_defaultShadingVariant/Looks/Cloth_C_Weave_09.
