# Reference to a prim in group.usda that has a subroot inherit to /Group/Model.
# group.usda</Group> has a variant selection of v=y. This case verifies that the
# variant selection used for the inherit arc in group.usda is /Group{v=y}/Model.
#
# The variant selection for the implied inherit for root.usda is 
# /Group{v=z}/Model. Ancestral variant selections encountered when composing
# subroot inherits do not apply when propagating implied inherits. This is 
# consistent with how we treat other ancestral arcs when propagating implied
# inherits.
# 
# This also is testing a bug that was previously causing a TF_VERIFY to be
# tripped in this exact scenario of a reference to a prim with a subroot inherit
# to another prim with an ancestral variant selection.

# SubrootReferenceAndVariants museum test.
# /RootRef's reference to /Model brings in a variant set 'v' with variant
# selection 'x'.
# /RootRef/Child's inherit of /Group/Model has an ancestral variant in that
# /Group also has a variant set 'v' but with a variant selection 'z'.
# This case is verifying that /Group/Model is composed with the variant
# selection of v=z, not v=x.
